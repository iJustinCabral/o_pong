# Pong written in Odin

I've recently been learning the odin programming language and wanted to continue getting familiar with raylib.

One of things I absolutely love about Odin is how it handles packages. 

### NO DEPENDENCY HELL!!!!

Odin treats directories as packages, and has no package manager (finally)...however they integrate 3rd party packages inside their **vendor** directory, such as raylib.

This makes using raylib as simple as *import "vendor:raylib"* ...and thats it! We're off and running. Odin so far has truly been a joy to write code in.
